# SuperPythonMario
<h2>Description</h2>
This game was made using Python's Arcade library. This was chosen as it is simpler than pyGame and at the time the quicker learning curve was useful to fullfil the time constraints of the project. The program uses images sourced from numerous scratch projects designed for these purposes and the level design was done myself with help from my partners. The code was written by me using python. This was an earlier project in my development journey but one I am proud of but this also means it has alot of room for improvment. 
<br><br>
The game consists of 5 levels, some of these levels however may have multiple steps within them. You can view the controls and more information within the game but it generally uses the expected game controls for most platformers. It should be noted however, you will need to complete each level in order to unlock those that follow. Once you have completed all levels they will remain unlocked for the time the game is running. If you close the game at any point you WILL LOSE ALL PROGRESS as there is no saved data capabilities for this game at this time.
<br><br>
NOTE: Make sure the image folder is in the same folder as the game file, to run simply run the python program and wait for the window to pop up.
